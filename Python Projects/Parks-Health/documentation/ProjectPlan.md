# Project Plan
By: Jack Damhorst, Ulyses Granados, Tarun Bathini
## Overview
The wellbeing of our biggest cities is crucial to the functioning of our democratic society. These major metropolitan areas play an essential role in raising families, building communities, and supporting all sorts of commerce. This project aims to explore whether the presence of public parks and green spaces in the nation's largest cities, as defined by the National Center for Education Statistics as an urban area with a population greater than 250,000, influences community health outcomes, such as lower obesity rates, increased physical activity, and improved mental health. We will investigate if and how access to parks contributes to a higher quality of life in these areas, using indicators such as obesity prevalence, physical activity levels, and mental wellness, among others. By examining these factors, we hope to gain insights into the role green spaces play in enhancing public health in large cities across our nation. Furthermore, this research may inform urban planning and policy decisions aimed at promoting healthier, more resilient communities. Understanding the impact of green spaces could help identify opportunities for investment in public health through environmental design, ensuring cities prioritize green spaces to benefit all residents.

## Research Question
- How does the availability of public parks in large cities correlate with obesity rates and physical activity levels among residents?
- Does access to public parks and green spaces in large cities contribute to improved mental health outcomes, such as reduced stress levels or higher self-reported well-being?
- Does access to bigger public parks in large cities have a greater effect on community health outcomes such as obesity rates, mental health outcomes, or physical activity?
## Team
**Member 1:** Jack Damhorst\
**Member 2:** Ulyses Granados\
**Member 3:** Tarun Bathini

Team member roles and responsibilities are clearly defined within the timeline. Member 1 will focus on documenting progress within the project report. Member 2 will work on data acquisition and management of the community health data while Member 3 will work with the public park data set. All members will collaborate on the integration, curation, and analysis of the data. The team will be communicative and help each other as needed. Our plan and timeline for implementing our project will have us prepared to take on each stage of the project and ensure we meet the final project requirements.

## Datasets
1. Trust for Public Land - ParkScore® Index:
The ParkScore® Index ranks cities in the U.S. based on park access, park investment, and park quality. The report includes data on how parks impact health indicators such as physical activity and obesity. This could be an excellent resource to measure park access and quality in relation to health outcomes. Trust for Public Land has a copyright for its materials. Under their Legal Disclosure and Terms of Use, they explain "you may download one copy of the information on this website for personal, non-commercial use. If you download, you may not modify the materials, use them for a commercial purpose or for public display, remove any copyright or trademark information, transfer the materials to another person, or allow unauthorized copying of the materials". Since we will be using this data for personal, educational purposes rather than commercial, we will be complying with the Trust for Public Land's user agreements and are permitted to use the data in our final project.

2. CDC’s PLACES Project:
The PLACES Project by the CDC provides local-level health data, including chronic disease indicators and health behaviors, which can be analyzed at the city or county level. This dataset covers outcomes like obesity, physical inactivity, and mental health, which you can relate to the availability of parks. Under Licensing and Attribution, the CDC explains that the data is public domain meaning it is not protected by intellectual property laws and we will be free to use it for our final project.

The ParkScore® Index from the Trust for Public Land and the dataset from the CDC PLACES Project have differences that satisfy the final project requirements. The CDC data will be collected via API while the Trust for Public Land will be downloaded. The CDC data is accessible under the public domain while the Trust for Public Land data has some copyright restrictions which we will follow accordingly.

## Timeline
### Week 11 (Oct. 27 - Nov. 2)
**Member 1:** Start drafting the project report in Markdown, with an emphasis on providing a detailed overview and refining the research questions.\
**Member 2:** Explore and document potential APIs for accessing community health data, including conducting preliminary tests and analyzing data structures.\
**Member 3:** Research sources for public park data, focusing on data availability, formats, syntax, and licensing requirements.
### Week 12 (Nov. 3 - Nov. 9)
**Member 1:** Support the evaluation of data sources and document the data acquisition process, noting any challenges or initial findings to ensure reproducibility.\
**Member 2:** Lead the community health data collection through chosen APIs, ensuring data integrity checks (checksums) are implemented.\
**Member 3:**  Gather public park data, ensuring it aligns with the project's diversity requirements regarding format, syntax, and licensing.
### Week 13 (Nov. 10 - Nov. 16) - Status Report Due Nov. 15
**All:** Work together on programmatic integration of the acquired datasets using Python/Pandas or SQL, ensuring smooth and logical merging of disparate data sources.\
**Member 1:** Thoroughly document the integration process in the project report.\
**Members 2 & 3:** Conduct initial analysis to explore the datasets, identifying any patterns or discrepancies that may impact subsequent phases of the project.
### Week 14 (Nov. 17 - Nov. 23)
**All:** Collaborate in thorough data profiling, cleaning, and quality assessment to prepare the data for in-depth analysis.\
**Member 1:** Document findings from the data cleaning process and initial analyses into the project report.\
**Members 2 & 3:** Lead the detailed analysis phase, applying statistical techniques to address the research questions.
### Fall Break
### Week 15 (Dec. 1 - Dec. 7)
**Member 1:** Develop visualizations to represent the analysis findings. Incorporate the analysis results and visualizations into the final report while ensuring the narrative is coherent and insightful.\
**Member 2:** Cite data and software used in the project accurately. Verify the project's successful end-to-end workflow execution.\
**Member 3:** Create a reproducible package and metadata that describes the research. Assist in refining the visualizations/analysis and contributing to the final sections of the project report.
### Week 16 (Dec. 8 - Dec. 11) - Final Project Submission Due Dec. 11 
**All:** Archive project in a repository, obtaining a persistent identifier. Perform a final review of the entire project, including the GitHub repository organization, documentation, code, and the completed project report.
