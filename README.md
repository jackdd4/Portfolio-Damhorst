Welcome to my Data Science portfolio! The projects here are currently all as jupyter notebooks in python. I have experience with SQL and R as well and am currently working on projects with these languages. I enjoy learning new skills through personal exploration and my education at the University of Illinois. I look foward to sharing more projects to this repo!
